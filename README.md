# Conditional Imitation Learning Agents 

I will implement interesting Conditional Imitation Learning agents for CARLA starting with a simple implementation of the paper [End-to-end Driving via Conditional Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.02410.pdf). 

# Network Architecture 

The authors tried two different architectures in the paper. We start with the left one.

# Dataset 

[Here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/imitation-learning) you can find detailed information on the dataset used for training the agent.
